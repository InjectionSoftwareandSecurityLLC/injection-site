                                                The security and hacking community is a strange one, but it's one we love and are proud to contribute to here at Injection Software and Security LLC.

                                                If you're involved with the community you'll know, and understand, that many of us maintain some sort of "handle" or screen name that we use to stand out in the community.
                                                The concept of a handle's presence, even in modern "hacker culture", is partially a historical thing, but for the most part, some of us just think it is fun, and we really like it.

                                                Casey holds many roles here at Injection Software and Security LLC. Founder/CEO/Lead Consultant, all of which are fine, but the title that is most important to him is that of "hacker".
                                                It's a title all consultants at Injection Software and Security LLC will share, and is one you can't find at most companies...because most companies aren't run by hackers!

                                                Not all hackers have handles of course, for those that do, it can become more than a nickname. A handle can become a sort of brand for those in this community at times. Many hackers who are known for their work are known by their handles.

                                                3ndG4me is a brand of sorts in that same vein. Not that it's a product or household name we expect you to know, but it's a person, attached to an identity, built around contributing to the hacking and security world. All of our YouTube content, blog posts, and even our services have a bit of personal flare to them captured by the handle of the contributor. Casey, being the founder of this company, is the primary contributor, as such, 3ndG4me is a name you may see often in relation to publications, talks, blogs, and videos that we produce here at Injection Software and Security LLC.

                                                    As a Security Engineer the core responsibilities are to serve as a subject matter experts on all things computer and information security. Daily responsibilities include a healthy mix of offensive security testing and DevSecOps automation work to proactively insure applications/systems are secure.

                                                    All work is client facing and usually related to the medical field, which often means strict government regulations and compliance standards to insure systems being developed are up to strict specifications. This provides a new challenge as each software application and infrastructure has its own unique challenges to tackle from a security perspective.

                                                    <br/>
                                                    Penetration testing is a major part of the job, with requirements often providing opportunities to test both custom software/systems and publicly available software applications. Sometimes this testing turns into vulnerability research with opportunities to discover new vulnerabilities in open public applications that can contribute to the broader security community.

                                                    <br/>
                                                    DevSecOps is a practice of automating out the trivial aspects of security to insure the low hanging fruit gets caught before penetration testing ever occurs, or worse, before the issue hits the public. This role takes a proactive approach, requiring one to think about the things you would do as an offensive security professional to hack into systems, automate as much as you can of that, and covert it into CI/CD pipelines for agile development. It is no easy feat, but each accomplishment in this area keeps the systems being developed more secure.

                                                     As a Manager of Information Security for a financial firm there are many critical requirements to keep up with. One of the key experiences during time spent in this role was leading the organization to PCI DSS Level 1 and both SOC 1 and 2 compliance statuses. This meant not only having to meet compliance goals, but also meeting brand new security standards this organization had never faced. 
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     During this role a small team was formed, SIEM infrastructure was built, and daily monitoring and incident response was conducted. In addition to this penetration testing services were developed and red teaming processes were standardized. It was a key responsibiltity not only to build and maintain these structures, but also to lead and execute the tasks within them. With a small team this managerial role required "getting your hands dirty" every single day.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Several incident response engagements were led preventing catastrophic events from permanently damaging the organization.
                                                     Dozens of offensive security engagements were also led to proactively catch vulnerabilities before they had a chance to become incidents.

                                                     Security Analyst means something different at many organizations. Often times its a SOC Analyst that performs alert triage and incident response, other times it's a penetration tester at a smaller consulting firm. There are many other connotations this title can bring, rarely however, is it both of these things and more.

                                                     <br/>
                                                     At a smaller financial company, this role was the first of its kind. Being the first dedicated security personnel means working closely with C-Level Executives to build a robust program, from nothing, to close many of the gaps needed to grow as an organization. 
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Initial responsibilities to begin with were building a developer security training curriculum and improving the organizational security awareness training to help enforce compliance goals and improve overall security posture.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     From there the next goal achieved was to establish a penetration testing practice in order to take a more proactive approach in identifying vulnerabilities while more robust monitoring capabilities were being researched.

                                                     Before transitioning into manager of the department, the final goal was to establish a defensive practice by building incident response playbooks and policies, improving logging and monitoring standards, and investing in a SIEM solution to aggregate the monitoring into a place where proper triage and DFIR can be conducted.

                                                     Working as Software Developer for 3 different companies over the years. Some were small freelance contracts, others client facing shops creating websites and mobile applications for customers. More significantly was a role working with a team to improve a set of products used by thousands across the nation.

                                                     As a software developer dozens of websites were created using various technologies such as jQuery, Angular, and PHP. Even more mobile applications were built using Objective-C, Swift, Java, and even hybrid frameworks like Ionic (Angular + Cordova).
                                                     The largest applications maintained were with a team of 4 written in jQuery, PHP, and MSSQL. These applications were complex and served thousands of customers. During this time several vulnerabilities were identified and remediated using experiences in application security.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Since many of these roles were at smaller organizations, being security conscious as developer went a long way. Occasionally penetration testing was a responsibility that was executed on, contributing to large security improvements in applications that had formerly never received any formal security testing at all.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     This established a practice of more secure SDLC processes built around the OWASP top 10 leaving the organization in a permanently better security posture.
                                                     <br/>
                                                     <br/>
                                                     Eventually, through continuously demonstrating the value of security, this built into a full time security role within a parent organization.

Configuring, running cables for, and installing enterprise grade wireless access services, then monitoring those services to protect from abuse daily.

This was accomplished with Apple TVs and iPads that were configured to allow streaming of more complex multi media content for developing new enhanced curriculums where VDI infrastructure was limited.

                                                    This exploit was published by the Shadow Brokers Group in their leak of NSA exploitation toolkits around April of 2017.

                                                    This exploit code is based on an automated monitor built in a Docker container by virtue security published on April 16th, 2020 and uses a "Proof of Concept" exploit from author Ross Bradley published on August 19th, 2020.

                                                    The Liferay Portal application (versions 7.1.0 through 7.2.1 GA2) is vulnerable to an authenticated persistent cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can allow a potential attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of another user's session.
                                                    This can be used to escalate privileges, move laterally, and in cases of administrative privilege escalation, even gain access to GroovyScript functionality in Liferay which can provide a path to remote code execution.

                                                    Specifically this research explores using SaltStack as a tool for command and control, advanced post exploitation, and even looks at ways that attacks can be performed against the SaltStack Software itself.
                                                    Furthermore, the talk presents remediation guidance for the attacks conducted, and provides clear indicators of compromise for defenders to be able to identify if someone is using tools, like SaltStack, maliciously in their environment.

                                                Alongside fellow researcher Cody Greene, under the guidance of research owner Suresh Damodaran of MITRE, a software based elevator simulation was developed. The goal of this simulator was to construct specific interfaces in order to provide mechanisms to simulate effects that would impact the system in the event of an attack or malfunction that might occur on a real elevator system.

                                                <br/>
                                                The broader contribution of this research was to demonstrate what kind of effects can occur whenever a cyber physical system, such as an elevator, is attacked. This simulation is intended to help others develop more attacks to test against the simulator, and determine what effects would occur if they were to be observed in a real elevator.

                                                <br/>
                                                Elevators are a great example of a cyber physical system that benefits from a simulation system being available, as it can be costly, and dangerous to test attacks against a real elevator.

                                                <br/>
                                                This research is continued by the folks at MITRE but the Elevator Simulator is open source to the public to improve upon, and develop more attacks for that contribute to the research.
